# Overview

This is a two-part demonstration.  The first part was released in September 2021 for the Azure Back To School Event.  The second part was released in December 2021 for connecting the Azure Digital Twins instance to a Time Series Insights environment to visualize your telemetry data.

## Azure Back to School 2021: *Part 1 - Create the telemetry from IoT sensors to Azure Digitial twins*

The first part takes you through the set up of the IoT hub, connection of the trailer sensors, creation of the Azure Function project, and an Event Grid trigger that sends telemetry to your Azure Digital Twins instance.

## Festive Tech Calendar 2021: *Part 2 - Create the Time Series Insights from Azure Digital Twins*

The second part takes you through the set up of the Event Hubs and the connection between the Azure Digital Twins and the Event Hubs via a second function in the Azure Functions project.  Since both are necessary and they do not conflict, for ease of delivery I decided to include both functions in the same project - you could separate them if you wanted to do so.
